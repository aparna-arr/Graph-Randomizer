= IDEA =
* creates a randomized graph which could work for an HMM model
* must have a non-self cycle
* first create graph with no self cycles
	* randomly connect each node to another node
* analyze to make sure it is fully connected (each node can get to each node)
* add in self-cycle for each node
* assign transition probabilities/weights
* nodes >= 2
